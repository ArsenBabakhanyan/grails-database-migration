In this section we will do a simple change to make a column nullable. The `age` column currently requires a variable. We
make it nullable, and proceed to migrate the database to reflect that.

In the `Person` domain object, make the age attribute nullable:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/grails/database/migration/Person.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/version-code/Person.groovy_v1[indent=0]
----

Note that making the change in the domain object does not affect the database. We must generate additions to the `changelog.groovy`
for the change to take affect. Run the commands below to run the database migration.

[source, bash]
----
> grails dbm-gorm-diff change-age-constraint-to-nullable.groovy --add // this will create a small file and append the name
changelog.groovy
> grails run-app
----

View the database tables again in MySql Command Client to see the column adjusted to be nullable.
