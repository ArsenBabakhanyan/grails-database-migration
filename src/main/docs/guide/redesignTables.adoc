Let's say we would like to redesign `Person` to split the address fields into its own domain object.  The idea behind this
would be that now a `Person` can have many `Address` 's. When doing this type of domain object redesign we have to consider a few aspects:

1. The database table schema definition will change
2. Existing data in the table will have to be split amongst the new database table created
3. We can write custom sql in the database migration to transfer existing data

The image below depicts the redesign:

The `Person` and `Address` domain objects can be coded as below:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/grails/database/migration/Person.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/grails/database/migration/Person.groovy[indent=0]
----

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/grails/database/migration/Address.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/grails/database/migration/Address.groovy[indent=0]
----

Create a controller with a scaffold in the appropriate package. This is so we can view it in the UI after the migration is performed.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/grails/database/migration/AddressController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/grails/database/migration/AddressController.groovy[indent=0]
----

Run the database migration command that will compare the new domain objects to the existing database and generate
the liquibase declarations to migrate the schema:

[source, bash]
----
> grails dbm-gorm-diff create-address-table.groovy â€“add
----

In order to move the existing data from the old tables to the new, we must add to the `create-address-table.groovy`. This custom sql
MUST execute after the creation of the `Address` table but before the dropping of columns from the `Person` table.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/migrations/change-address-table.groovy
----
// creation of address...
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/migrations/create-address-table.groovy[tags=customDataSql]
// drop person columns...
----

Run the Grails application. And view the data is migrated

[source, bash]
----
> grails run-app
----

Check the table descriptions in the MySql Client:

----
> show tables;
> select * from person;
> describe person;
> select * from address;
> describe address;
----
